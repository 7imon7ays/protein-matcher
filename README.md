The tip of master should be running at [protein-matcher.herokuapp.com](https://protein-matcher.herokuapp.com/)

To run it locally, clone this repo, navigate to the project root, and run `make`. This command launches the containerized web app components, including the PostgreSQL database. Make sure you don't have another process, such as another PostgreSQL server, listening on port 5432.
